# Product preview card component ðŸ›’
I started learning frontend this vacation.  After a tough month of learning, I decided to take up the challenge.  I'm new to the community and wanted to check if I'm good enough to continue this adventure.  Honestly, this time wasn't the worst.  This problem took me  around 4 hours. The most difficult has been the proper use of overflow. It didn't want to work for a while, and I didn't want to solve that with border-radius property.ðŸ˜œ After all, I decided to take up new challenges.

This is my solution to the challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Their challenges help improve coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## The challenge
