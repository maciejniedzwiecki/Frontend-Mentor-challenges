# Frontend Mentor challenges ðŸ¤“

My name is Maciej NiedÅºwiecki. I am a student of the Poznan University of Technology in the field of Electronics and Telecommunications. I started learning frontend technologies this summer and I enjoyed it a lot. I'm new to the community and wanted to check if I'm good enough to continue this adventure. After all, I decided to take up new challenges.

There are my solutions to challenges on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Their challenges help improve coding skills by building realistic projects.
